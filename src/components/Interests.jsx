            <p>Before working as a developer, I worked as an interpreter for the courts of the State of New York. I'm curious about languages, natural and otherwise. On my free time you can find me reading, doing yoga, baking bread, finding efficiencies. I enjoy dancing and cooking for friends and family.</p>
